        <p>I am Zoe the cow and even though I am usually an extremely relaxed and peaceful cow. I have been really angry for the past couple of days. Why you ask. Well the whole climate change and greenhouse gases situation is causing a number of problems for me. The amount of damage these are causing is unspeakable. The damage these things are bringing to me are beyond repair. Let me try to explain to you how bad this is for me and my fellow farm animal community. Greenhouse gasses and climate change impact us exponentially. It changes our habits, health and our ability to eat or drink. The escalating temperatures can lead to us having a lot of heat stress and it being really hot inside our bodies. A lot of heat stress in our body can lead to reducing our productivity, fertility and also affect hoe fast our immune system responds to any unwanted bacteria. This means that I could catch a dangerous disease which will be life threatening because of this. Additionally the changing weather and precipitation patterns affect the growth of feed crops and shortages le as ding to higher costs. Further more as well as worrying about all those reasons I also have to worry about natural disaster like droughts and floods which further distribute grazing lands and water sources, this makes it harder for us to remain healthy. These don't only effect me and the rest of the farm animals it also effects you humans. It effects you because if there are not healthy herds and farm animals it will lead to a lot of food scarcity and more economical unsustainibility in the whole world which will pause the development of the world.
