                <h2>About Us</h2> 
    
                <p> 
                    We are a group of passionate students who, like many others, grew up believing that agriculture was a symbol of sustainability and life. But after learning how modern farming practices actually contribute to climate change, we were shocked. This revelation challenged everything we thought we knew.

That is why we started Roots of Warmingâ€”a platform dedicated to uncovering and sharing the truth about how agriculture impacts the environment. Through our blog, we aim to tell stories that explain the hidden environmental costs of what we grow and consume, and inspire conversations about creating a more sustainable future.

Join us on this journey as we explore the roots of global warming and advocate for change in how we think about agriculture and the planet.

                <h2>Why Agriculture</h2> 
         
                <p> 
                    Agriculture, while essential for feeding the world, has a significant negative impact on the environment. Modern farming practices contribute to global warming through deforestation, soil degradation, and the release of greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide from livestock and fertilizers. Agriculture is responsible for approximately 19-29% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Livestock alone contributes 14.5% of total emissions. The use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers further pollutes the air, soil, and water. All these factors combine to make agriculture a leading driver of climate change, creating a pressing need for more sustainable farming practices. Large scale farming also depletes natural resources, leads to biodiversity loss, and consumes enormous amounts of water.

                <h2>Who we are talking to</h2> 
                
                <p> 
                    Our target audience is mainly children ages 8-13 because it is very important to gain knowledge about a topic as serious as climate change at a young age. That is why we are informing them how although everyone corelates agriculture and a healthy planet, there are several downfalls to agriculture. In order for the children to understand, we are using short stories to make it intresting for them.

                <h2>Our Aim</h2> 
            
                <p> 
                    At Roots of Warming, our aim is to raise awareness about the significant impact of modern agriculture on climate change and to foster a dialogue around sustainable practices. We seek to educate our peers and the broader community on how agricultural practices contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and biodiversity loss.

Through informative articles, engaging stories, and compelling statistics, we hope to inspire action and encourage individuals to rethink their food choices and advocate for sustainable farming methods. Our goal is not only to highlight the challenges but also to promote solutions that can help mitigate climate change and create a healthier planet for future generations.
