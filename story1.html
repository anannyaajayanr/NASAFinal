        <p>Meet Stella, a girl that has been living in a place where agriculture blooms all around her. She loved it there. She loved the fact that she could play hide and seek behind the large flowers, and smell the air with the essence of her favorite flowers. The only bad thing about her is that shes very sensitive to the heat, but that never stops her! Also, she cares about the crops alot, due to the fact that the family worked so hard to be able to grow the farm that they have now. Her mother and father, both being farmers, influenced her to be a farmer. But, as she grew older, the world started to become more cruel. She noticed that her parents where using chemical fertilizers. Curious, she asks her parents what its for. “Oh honey, its used to promote agricultural production,” Says her  mom. Although, she stil had so many questions. But, her main one was that she though chemical fertlizers was harming the planet it some way. So, she went to her room and started typing on her laptop. Next thing you know, she was opening hundreds of pages and articles, answering all her questions whilst her jaw stayed dropped. “Agriculture is the reason for 10 precent of greenhouse gas emissions, especially due to chemical fretalizers.” She remeberd learning about greenhouse gas emissions in school, knowing that it is a gas onthe earth in which traps heat around the atmosphere. Devastated, she is eager to find a solution online, but nothing. So, the next moring she decides to put matters into her own hands, trying to stop her parents form doing it. As soon as she went outside, there it was. They were using it again, and before she could stop them, the heat got to her. It started becoming so hot, that she dropped to the ground, and fainted. As she fainted, the crops started to dry drastically. All the years of hard work fell apart right infront of the moms eyes, but the heat wal too much to bareso the mom carried her daughter inside. News reports started and everyone was talking about the drastic change in heat, and how all around the world, everyone was being affected. Hours later, she woke up to the sound of a sigh of relief by her mom. But, before she sad anything, she was eager to tell them about what she encountered last night. “Mom, chemical fretalizers are the reason for 10 precent of greenhouse gas emissions, which makes the weather burning hot. So, the reason this happend to me is because of the immense amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere that caused the heat.” Worried, her parenta look at eachother and said “We will make a change, we promise. A couple days later, i woke up to a croud of people outside. I opened the window, and heard my mom say exactly what i told her, hearing the cheering and clapping of people outside. The chemical fertlizers were no where to be found, and alternatives like Manure was being used, I couldnt help but smile. As the weeks past, our crops started growing bigger, brighter, and better. But the heat, it dident stop. Millions of people kept doing it, not knowing abouyt the consequences, and Stellas health problems got worse, and worse. So, her mom started to take even more action, by going on the news and explaining this compelling sotry about her daughter! Millions of people where interested, and soon enough, it started getting better. Just like the mom took action, you can too. </p>
